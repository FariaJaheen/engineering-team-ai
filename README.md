# AI Multi-Agent Engineering Team System

## Overview
This project implements a production-style multi-agent software engineering team using the CrewAI framework. The system simulates a structured engineering workflow in which specialized AI agents collaborate to design, develop, validate, and demonstrate a complete Python software module from high-level requirements. The architecture models a realistic engineering organization consisting of an Engineering Lead, Backend Engineer, Frontend Engineer, and Test Engineer. Together, these agents transform product requirements into a fully functional backend system, a working user interface, and comprehensive automated tests. This repository demonstrates how multi-agent AI systems can be applied to real-world software engineering workflows, enabling autonomous design, implementation, testing, and delivery of production-ready code.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to simulate an autonomous engineering team capable of:

- Translating high-level product requirements into detailed technical designs  
- Implementing clean, testable backend systems  
- Creating lightweight user interfaces for demonstration  
- Generating comprehensive automated test suites  
- Delivering production-style, self-contained Python modules  

The system is designed as a practical demonstration of agentic AI applied to software engineering automation and intelligent developer tooling.

## System Architecture

### Engineering Team Hierarchy

The system is implemented as a structured, sequential multi-agent engineering workflow in which each agent performs a specialized task. Outputs generated by earlier agents are passed as context to downstream agents, ensuring consistency, traceability, and alignment across the entire development lifecycle. The workflow mirrors a real-world software engineering team where design precedes implementation, followed by interface development and testing.

→ Backend Engineer  
→ Frontend Engineer  
→ Test Engineer

## Agent Responsibilities

### Engineering Lead
Produces a detailed backend design specification based on high-level requirements. Defines module structure, class design, function signatures, validation strategy, and usage examples.

### Backend Engineer
Implements the complete backend Python module according to the design specification. Ensures the module is self-contained, testable, production-style, and ready for integration with a user interface.

### Frontend Engineer
Creates a simple Gradio-based user interface to demonstrate backend functionality. Ensures the backend module can be easily tested interactively by users.

### Test Engineer
Develops comprehensive unit tests using the Python standard library. Covers core functionality, edge cases, and validation logic to ensure reliability.

## Workflow

1. **Design Phase**  
   Engineering Lead produces a structured backend design specification.

2. **Implementation Phase**  
   Backend Engineer builds the complete Python module.

3. **Frontend Phase**  
   Frontend Engineer creates a simple demonstration UI.

4. **Testing Phase**  
   Test Engineer generates unit tests for validation and reliability.

5. **Output Delivery**  
   All artifacts are saved to the output directory for inspection and execution.

---

## Example Use Case
The system can be used to automatically build software modules such as:

- Trading simulation account systems  
- Data processing pipelines  
- Automation tools  
- Backend APIs  
- Educational software modules  
- Simulation environments  

The current configuration demonstrates generation of an account management system for a trading simulation platform.

## Installation

Ensure Python version between 3.10 and 3.13.

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install uv
uv sync
pip install crewai
```

---

## Running the System
```
crewai run
```
---

## Running the Generated Application
After the multi-agent workflow completes, a working backend module and Gradio interface will be available inside the output/ directory.
Navigate to the output directory:
```
cd output
```
Run the generated application:
```
uv add gradio
uv run app.py
```
Open the URL in your browser to interact with the generated application and test backend functionality through the UI.<br>
The Gradio interface allows you to:<br>
	•	Interactively test backend features<br>
	•	Validate functionality and logic<br>
	•	Demonstrate system behavior visually<br>
	•	Confirm the module is ready for integration or extension<br>

This step verifies that the generated backend module is fully functional and production-ready.

## Use Cases

This repository demonstrates practical applications of multi-agent AI systems in:<br>
	•	Autonomous software engineering <br>
	•	Intelligent developer tooling <br>
	•	AI-driven code generation pipelines <br>
	•	Rapid prototyping and validation <br>
	•	Educational demonstrations of agentic workflows <br>
	•	Research in collaborative AI engineering systems <br>

It serves as a reference architecture for building AI-powered engineering teams capable of structured collaboration.
